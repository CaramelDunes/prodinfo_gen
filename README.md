prodinfo_gen [![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/CaramelDunes/prodinfo_gen.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/CaramelDunes/prodinfo_gen)
============
prodinfo_gen is a Nintendo Switch payload that can generate barely-working, console-unique, PRODINFO files.

It can either generate one from scratch or modify a donor PRODINFO.

It is primarily aimed at people without a backup of their PRODINFO or building a NAND from scratch.

Limitations
===========

Of course, as we do not have Nintendo's private keys, the generated files can't be perfect.

What *should* work with a **"from scratch"** PRODINFO:
 - Booting
 - Launching homebrews

What *won't* work with a **"from scratch"** PRODINFO:
 - Communicating with Nintendo's servers
 - Amiibos (not tested)
 - GameCards

What *should* work with a **"from donor"** PRODINFO:
 - Booting
 - Launching homebrews
 - GameCards
 - Amiibos (not tested)

**Note:** Using a recent Switch (i.e. Mariko) PRODINFO as a donor is not yet supported.

**USE THIS TOOL AT YOUR OWN RISK, DO NOT OVERWRITE A FACTORY PRODINFO WITHOUT MAKING A BACKUP FIRST.**

Usage
=====
* Make sure you have a `/switch/prod.keys` file on your microSD card with a valid `master_key_00` in it.
* If you want to use a donor PRODINFO, place it at `/switch/donor_prodinfo.bin`.
* Launch prodinfo_gen.bin using your favorite payload injector or chainloader.
* You should find `/switch/generated_prodinfo_from_scratch.bin` or `/switch/generated_prodinfo_from_donor.bin` depending on what you selected.
* You can now write that PRODINFO to your NAND using a tool such as HacDiskMount.

Building
========
Install [devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/) and run `make`.
